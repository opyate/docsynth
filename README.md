Rough draft of a more sophisticated (and private) tool I use with which to synthesise documents.

# Document synthesis

    make run

Need more variation? Put more text prefabs in [docsynth/lib/assets/prefabs/text](docsynth/lib/assets/prefabs/text).

# Conda

Create a new environment for the first time with:

    conda env create -f conda-env.yml


## Notes

```
conda create -n synth36  pip  python=3.6
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
conda activate synth36
```
